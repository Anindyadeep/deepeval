The bias metric determines whether your LLM output contains gender, racial, or political bias. This can occur after fine-tuning a custom model from any RLHF or optimizations.

:::info
Bias in `deepeval` is a **referenceless** metric. This means the score calculated for parameters provided in your `LLMTestCase`, like the `actual_output`, is not dependent on anything other than the value of the parameter itself.
:::

## Installation

Bias in `deepeval` requires an additional installation:

```
pip install Dbias
```

## Required Arguments

To use the `BiasMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`

## Example

```python
from deepeval.metrics import BiasMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

metric = BiasMetric(threshold=0.5)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
    actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
```

:::note
Unlike other metrics you've seen so far, the `threshold` for the `BiasMetric` is instead a maxmium threshold.
