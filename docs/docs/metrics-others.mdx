`deepeval` offers a few additional metrics for you to plug and use. They follow the same interface as all the previous metrics you've encountered, and using them is as simple as importing them in the `metrics` module.

```python
from deepeval.metrics.ragas import ConcisenessMetric
from deepeval.metrics.ragas import CorrectnessMetric
from deepeval.metrics.ragas import CoherenceMetric
from deepeval.metrics.ragas import MaliciousnessMetric
```
