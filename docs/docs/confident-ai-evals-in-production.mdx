## Quick Summary

`deepeval` allows you to track events in production to enable real-time evaluation on responses. By tracking events, you can leverage our hosted evaluation infrastructure to identify unsatisfactory responses and improve your evaluation dataset over time on Confident.

## Setup Tracking

Simply add `deepeval.track(...)` in your application to start tracking events.

```python
import deepeval
...

# At the end of your LLM call
deepeval.track(
    event_name="Chatbot",
    model="gpt-4",
    input="input",
    output="output",
    distinct_id="a user Id",
    conversation_id="a conversation thread Id",
    retrieval_context=["..."],
    completion_time=8.23,
    token_usage=134,
    token_cost=0.23,
    additional_data={"example": "example"},
    fail_silently=True,
    run_on_background_thread=True
)

```

The `track()` function takes in the following arguments:

- `event_name`: type `str` specifying the event tracked
- `model`: type `str` specifying the name of the LLM model used
- `input`: type `str`
- `output`: type `str`
- [Optional] `distinct_id`: type `str` to identify different users using your LLM application
- [Optional] `conversation_id`: type `str` to group together multiple messages under a single conversation thread
- [Optional] `completion_time`: type `float` that indicates how many **seconds** it took your LLM application to complete
- [Optional] `retrieval_context`: type `list[str]` that indicates the context that were retrieved in your RAG pipeline
- [Optional] `token_usage`: type `float`
- [Optional] `token_cost`: type `float`
- [Optional] `additional_data`: type `dict`
- [Optional] `fail_silently`: type `bool`, defaults to True. You should try setting this to `False` if your events are not logging properly.
- [Optional] `run_on_background_thread`: type `bool`, defaults to True. You should try setting this to `False` if your events are not logging properly.

## Track Events on Confident AI

Confident offers an observatory to view events and identify ones where you want to augment your evaluation dataset with.

If you're building an LLM chatbot, you can also view entire conversation threads via the `conversation_id`.

## Enable Real-Time Evals

To monitor how your LLM application is performing over time, and be alerted of any unsatisfactory LLM responses in production, head to the "projects details" section via the left navigation drawer to turn on the metrics you wish to enable in production. Confident AI will automatically run evaluations for enabled metrics for all incoming events.
