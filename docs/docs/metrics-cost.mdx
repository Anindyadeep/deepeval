The cost metric is another performance metric offered by `deepeval`, and measures whether the token cost of your LLM (application) is economically acceptable.

## Required Arguments

To use the `CostMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `cost`

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import CostMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

metric = CostMetric(max_cost=0.4)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="...",
    actual_output="...",
    cost=0.34
)

metric.measure(test_case)
# True if cost <= max_cost
print(metric.is_successful())
```

:::note
Similar to `LatencyMetric`, the `CostMetric` threshold, `max_cost`, does **NOT** have any standard units. However, you need to make sure the monetary units you provide in the `cost` argument when creating an `LLMTestCase` matches that of the cost `max_cost`.
