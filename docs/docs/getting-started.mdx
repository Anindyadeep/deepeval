**DeepEval** is an open-source evaluation framework for LLMs. DeepEval makes it extremely easy to build
and iterate on LLM (applications) and was built with the following principles in mind:

- Easily "unit test" LLM outputs in a similar way to Pytest.
- Plug-and-use 14+ LLM-evaluated metrics, most with research backing.
- Custom metrics are simple to personalize and create.
- Define evaluation datasets in Python code.
- Real-time evaluations in production (available on Confident AI).

## Setup A Python Environement

Go to the root directory of your project and create a virtual environement (if you don't already have one). In the CLI, run:

```console
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

In your newly created virtual environement, run:

```console.log
pip install -U deepeval
```

You can also keep track of all evaluation results by logging onto [Confident AI, an all in one evaluation platform](https://app.confident-ai.com):

```console
deepeval login
```

## Create Your First Test Case

Run `touch test_example.py` to create a test file in your root directory. Open `test_example.py` and paste in your first test case:

```python title="test_example.py"
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

def test_answer_relevancy():
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
        # Replace this with the actual output of your LLM application
        actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
        retrieval_context=["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [answer_relevancy_metric])
```

Run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project:

```console
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

**Congratulations! Your test case should have passed âœ…** Let's breakdown what happened.

- The variable `input` mimics a user input, and `actual_output` is a placeholder for what your application's supposed to output based on this input.
- The variable `retrieval_context` contains the retrieved context from your knowledge base, and `AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)` is an default metric provided by `deepeval` for you to evaluate your LLM output's relevancy based on the provided retrieval context.
- All metric scores range from 0 - 1, which the `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines if your test have passed or not.

:::info
You'll need to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an enviornment variable before running the `AnswerRelevancyMetric`, since the `AnswerRelevancyMetric` is an LLM-evaluated metric. To use **ANY** custom LLM of your choice, [check out this part of the docs](evaluation-introduction#using-a-custom-llm).
:::

You can also save test results locally for each test run. Simply set the `DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER` environement variable to your relative path of choice:

```console
export DEEPEVAL_RESULTS_FOLDER="./data"
```

## Create Your First Custom Metric

`deepeval` provides two types of custom metric to evaluate LLM outputs: metrics evaluated with LLMs and metrics evaluated without LLMs. Here is a brief overview of each:

### LLM Evaluated Metrics

An LLM evaluated metric (aka. LLM-Evals), is one where evaluation is carried out by an LLM. `deepeval` offers more than a dozen LLM-Evals, one of which is G-Eval, a state-of-the-art framework to evaluate LLM outputs.

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import GEval
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase, LLMTestCaseParams
...

def test_coherence():
    coherence_metric = GEval(
        name="Coherence",
        criteria="Coherence - determine if the actual output is logical, has flow, and is easy to understand and follow.",
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
        threshold=0.5
    )
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="What if these shoes don't fit? I want a full refund.",
        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
        actual_output="If the shoes don't fit, the customer wants a full refund."
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [coherence_metric])
```

:::info
All of `deepeval`'s default metrics are LLM-Evals, most of which are backed by associated research papers. To learn more, here is an article on [everything you need to know about LLM evaluation metrics](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/llm-evaluation-metrics-everything-you-need-for-llm-evaluation).
:::

### Non-LLM Evaluated Metrics

A non-LLM evaluated metric is a metric where evluation is not carried out by another LLM. Since all of `deepeval`'s metrics are evaluated using LLMs, you'll have to created a custom metric instead by defining the `measure` and `is_successful` methods upon inheriting the base `BaseMetric` class.

```python title="test_example.py"
from deepeval.metrics import BaseMetric
...

class LengthMetric(BaseMetric):
    # This metric checks if the output length is greater than 10 characters
    def __init__(self, max_length: int=10):
        self.threshold = max_length

    def measure(self, test_case: LLMTestCase):
        self.success = len(test_case.actual_output) > self.threshold
        if self.success:
            score = 1
        else:
            score = 0
        return score

    def is_successful(self):
        return self.success

    @property
    def __name__(self):
        return "Length"


def test_length():
    length_metric = LengthMetric(max_length=10)
    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
        # Replace this with the actual output of your LLM application
        actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [length_metric])
```

Run `deepeval test run` from the root directory of your project again:

```console
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

You should see both `test_answer_relevancy` and `test_length` passing.

**Two things to note:**

- Custom metrics requires a `threshsold` as a passing criteria. In the case of our `LengthMetric`, the passing criteria was whether the `max_length` of `actual_output` is greater than 10.
- We removed `retrieval_context` in `test_length` since it was irrelevant to evaluating output length. However `input` and `actual_output` is always mandatory when creating an `LLMTestCase`.

:::tip
You can also create a custom metric to combine several different metrics into one. For example. combining the `AnswerRelevancyMetric` and `FaithfulnessMetric` to test whether an LLM output is both relevant and faithful (ie. not hallucinating).

[Click here to learn more on how to create a custom metric](metrics-custom)
:::

## Combine Your Metrics

You might've noticed we have duplicated test cases for both `test_answer_relevancy` and `test_length` (ie. they have the same input and expected output). To avoid this redundancy, `deepeval` offers an easy way to apply as many metrics as you wish for a single test case.

```python title="test_example.py"
...

def test_everything():
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)
    length_metric = LengthMetric(max_length=10)
    coherence_metric = GEval(
        name="Coherence",
        criteria="Coherence - determine if the actual output is logical, has flow, and is easy to understand and follow.",
        evaluation_params=[LLMTestCaseParams.ACTUAL_OUTPUT],
        threshold=0.5
    )

    test_case = LLMTestCase(
        input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
        # Replace this with the actual output of your LLM application
        actual_output="We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost.",
        retrieval_context=["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]
    )
    assert_test(test_case, [answer_relevancy_metric, coherence_metric, length_metric])
```

In this scenario, `test_everything` only passes if all metrics are passing. Run `deepeval test run` again to see the results:

```console
deepeval test run test_example.py
```

## Evaluate Your Evaluation Dataset

An evaluation dataset in `deepeval` is simply a collection of `LLMTestCases` and/or `Goldens`.

:::tip
We're not going to dive into what a `Golden` is here, but it is an important concept if you're looking to generate LLM outputs at evlauation time. To learn more about `Golden`s, [click here.](evaluation-dataset#with-goldens)
:::

Using `deepeval`'s Pytest integration, you can utilize the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to loop through and evaluate your evaluation dataset.

```python title="test_dataset.py"
import pytest
from deepeval import assert_test
from deepeval.metrics import FaithfulnessMetric, AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase
from deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset

first_test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...", context=["..."])
second_test_case = LLMTestCase(input="...", actual_output="...", context=["..."])

# Initialize an evaluation dataset by supplying a list of test cases
dataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[first_test_case, second_test_case])

# Loop through test cases using Pytest
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "test_case",
    dataset,
)
def test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):
    faithfulness_metric = FaithfulnessMetric(threshold=0.3)
    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)
    assert_test(test_case, [faithfulness_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])
```

You can also run test cases in parallel by using the optional `-n` flag followed by a number (that determines the number of processes that will be used) when executing `deepeval test run`:

```
deepeval test run test_dataset.py -n 2
```

Alternatively, you can evaluate entire datasets without going through the CLI (if you're in a notebook environment):

```python
...

evaluate(test_cases, [faithfulness_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])
```

### Compare Hyperparameters

To log hyperparameters (such as prompt templates used) for your LLM application, paste in the following code in `test_example.py`:

```python title="test_example.py"
import deepeval
...

# Just an example of prompt_template
prompt_template = """You are a helpful assistant, answer the following question in a non-judgemental tone.

Question:
{question}
"""

# Although the values in this example are hardcoded,
# you should ideally pass in variables to keep things dynamic
@deepeval.log_hyperparameters(model="gpt-4", prompt_template=prompt_template)
def hyperparameters():
    # Any additional hyperparameters you wish to keep track of
    return {
        "chunk_size": 500,
        "temperature": 0
    }
```

Execute `deepeval test run test_example.py` again to start comparing hyperparmeters for each test run.
