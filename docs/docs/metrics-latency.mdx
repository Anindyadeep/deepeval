The latency metric measures whether the completion time of your LLM (application) is efficient and meets the expected time limits. It is one of the two performance metrics offered by `deepeval`.

:::info
Performance metrics in `deepeval` are metrics that evaluate aspects such as latency and cost, rather than the outputs of your LLM (application).
:::

## Required Arguments

To use the `LatencyMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `latency`

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import LatencyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

metric = LatencyMetric(max_latency=10.0)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="...",
    actual_output="...",
    latency=9.9
)

metric.measure(test_case)
# True if latency <= max_latency
print(metric.is_successful())
```

:::note

It does not matter what unit of time you provide the `max_latency` argument with, it only has to match the unit of `latency` when creating an `LLMTestCase`.
