sidebar_label: Contextual Relevancy
---

The contextual relevancy metric measures the quality of your RAG pipeline's retriever by evaluating the overall relevance of the information presented in your `retrieval_context` for a given `input`. `deepeval`'s contextual relevancy metric is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

## Required Arguments

To use the `ContextualRelevancyMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `retrieval_context`

:::note
Similar to `ContextualPrecisionMetric`, the `ContextualRelevancyMetric` uses `retrieval_context` from your RAG pipeline for evaluation.
:::

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import ContextualRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = ContextualRelevancyMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are three optional parameters when creating a `ContextualRelevancyMetricMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** any one of langchain's [chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/) of type `BaseChatModel`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4-1106-preview'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.

You can also choose to fallback to Ragas' contextual relevancy metric (which has a similar implemention). This however is not capable of generating a reason.

```python
from deepeval.metrics.ragas import RAGASContextualRelevancyMetric
```
