import Equation from "@site/src/components/equation";

The answer relevancy metric measures the quality of your RAG pipeline's generator by evaluating how relevant the `actual_output` of your LLM application is compared to the provided `input`. `deepeval`'s answer relevancy metric is a self-explaining LLM-Eval, meaning it outputs a reason for its metric score.

You can run [real-time evaluations in production](confident-ai-evals-in-production) on metrics such as `AnswerRelevancyMetric` using Confident AI.

## Required Arguments

To use the `AnswerRelevancyMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(
    threshold=0.7,
    model="gpt-4",
    include_reason=True
)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)
print(metric.reason)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```

There are three optional parameters when creating an `AnswerRelevancyMetric`:

- [Optional] `threshold`: a float representing the minimum passing threshold, defaulted to 0.5.
- [Optional] `model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4-0125-preview'.
- [Optional] `include_reason`: a boolean which when set to `True`, will include a reason for its evaluation score. Defaulted to `True`.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `AnswerRelevancyMetric` score is calculated according to the following equation:

<Equation formula="\text{Answer Relevancy} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Statements}}{\text{Total Number of Statements}}" />

The `AnswerRelevancyMetric` first uses an LLM to extract all statements made in the `actual_output`, before using the same LLM to classify whether each statement is relevant to the `input` using additional context from the `retrieval_context`.
