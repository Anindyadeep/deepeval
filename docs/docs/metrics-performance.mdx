Performance metrics in `deepeval` are metrics that evaluate aspects such as latency and cost, rather than the outputs of your LLM (application).

:::note
While some performance metrics are related to LLM applications (eg. Latency and Cost), others are for the LLM itself (eg. tokens/s).
:::

## Latency

The latency metric measures whether the completion time of your LLM application is efficient and meets the expected time limits. It is one of the two performance metrics offered by `deepeval`.

### Required Arguments

To use the `LatencyMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `max_latency`

### Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import LatencyMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

metric = LatencyMetric(max_latency=10.0)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="...",
    actual_output="...",
    latency=9.9
)

metric.measure(test_case)
# True if latency <= max_latency
print(metric.is_successful())
```

:::tip
It does not matter what unit of time you provide the `max_latency` argument with, it only has to match the unit of `latency` when creating an `LLMTestCase`.
:::

## Cost

The cost metric is another performance metric offered by `deepeval`, and measures whether the token cost of your LLM application is economically acceptable.

### Required Arguments

To use the `CostMetric`, you'll have to provide the following arguments when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `max_cost`

### Example

```python
from deepeval.metrics import CostMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

metric = CostMetric(max_cost=0.4)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="...",
    actual_output="...",
    cost=0.34
)

metric.measure(test_case)
# True if cost <= max_cost
print(metric.is_successful())
```

:::note
Similar to `LatencyMetric`, the `CostMetric` threshold, `max_cost`, does **NOT** have any standard units. However, you need to make sure the monetary units you provide in the `cost` argument when creating an `LLMTestCase` matches that of the cost `max_cost`.
