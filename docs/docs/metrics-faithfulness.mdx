Faithfulness measures hallucination in a RAG pipeline to ensure output aligns with the retrieved context. It evaluates the quality of your RAG pipeline's generator and is calculated using `actual_output` and `retrieval_context`.

:::info
Although similar to the `HallucinationMetric`, the faithfulness metric in `deepeval` is more concerned with hallucination in RAG pipelines, rather than the actual LLM itself.
:::

## Required Parameters

To use the `FaithfulnessMetric`, you'll have to provide the following parameters when creating an `LLMTestCase`:

- `input`
- `actual_output`
- `retrieval_context`

## Example

```python
from deepeval import evaluate
from deepeval.metrics import FaithfulnessMetric
from deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase

# Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application
actual_output = "We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra cost."

# Replace this with the actual retrieved context from your RAG pipeline
retrieval_context = ["All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra cost."]

metric = FaithfulnessMetric(minimum_score=0.5)
test_case = LLMTestCase(
    input="What if these shoes don't fit?",
    actual_output=actual_output,
    retrieval_context=retrieval_context
)

metric.measure(test_case)
print(metric.score)

# or evaluate test cases in bulk
evaluate([test_case], [metric])
```
